"""Gate uploads before any analysis runs.

The models in this project are closed-set classifiers: the disease model always
returns one of five sugarcane conditions, the soil model always returns one of
four soil types. Neither has a "none of these" output, so given a photograph of
a person they will still answer, and answer confidently - a portrait was
returned as "Clay Soil, 62 % confidence". A closed-set classifier cannot refuse;
something in front of it has to.

Validation runs in two stages, because "is this a plant at all" and "is this
plant sugarcane" are genuinely different problems:

Stage A - measurable, no model required. Colour composition separates
vegetation, bare soil and everything else (people, buildings, screenshots,
food, objects) reliably enough to reject the obvious cases. Calibrated on 250
sugarcane, 250 maize and 250 soil photographs.

Stage B - the trained validator model. Stage A cannot tell sugarcane from
maize: measured on those samples, vegetation cover is 0.57 median for sugarcane
and 0.66 for maize, which overlaps almost completely. Long green blade-shaped
leaves are long green blade-shaped leaves. Only a model trained with maize as
an explicit negative can make that call, so if the validator model is missing,
say so rather than pretending Stage A settled it.
