"""Sugarcane disease classification.

Two clearly separated modes:

* ``trained_model`` - a Keras model saved at ``models/sugarcane_disease_model.keras``
  is loaded and used. TensorFlow is imported lazily so it is never a hard
  dependency of the web API.
* ``demo_heuristic`` - no trained model is present, so a transparent colour and
  texture heuristic produces a *demonstration* estimate. Every response built
  from this mode is labelled DEMO and carries the measured features that drove
  it, so nothing is hidden behind a fake accuracy number.

The heuristic is NOT a validated diagnostic tool and the code never claims it is.
